Hello! If you are reading this, then you are looking at Project Maus, created by Sean and Brendan. This project is dedicated to the research and development of an angiographical
power injector. This repository will include CAD files, code (written in python most likely), as well as anything else that might be relevant to this project. Thanks for reading.
